  //how to play: 
  //1. mastermind chooses four, in this case, letter and keeps them secret, the secret code.
  //2. the codebreaker provide a guess to see if they can figure out the secret code. 
  //3. After the guess is made, the mastermind must provide hints to the codebreaker
    // if the code breaker provided:
       //a. if th guess matches the secret code
          // the game is over 

          //else 
        //b. if the letter and location with the guess matches
          //return 1 for each match 
        //c. if the letter matches, but the location does not
          //return 1 for each match 
        //d. if no matches can be found, return nothing 
    //4. as long as 3.a. - winning - has not occurred, continue 3.b. - 3.d. until 10 guess have been made.
    //5. if there has been 10 guesses and a correct guess has not been made
        // the mastermind wins
        //the codebreaker loses
