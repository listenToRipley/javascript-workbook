Life scenario - just the logistics of signing up, not the rules of the game 
You sign up to play dodge ball
  they ask you: 
    do you know how to play?
      if so:

        throw?
        dodge? 
    have to paid you fee? 
    are you in good healthy?
someone decides what team you're going to be one given their own set of criteria 
you then become a member of that team. 
  you know the color of your team and the mascot 
now you are ready to play

These are the rules we're deals with
People sign up to play dodge ball.  
Apply the player details to each of those individuals 
Display that list 
Sort those individuals into 1 of 2 teams 
  Once added:
   Remove that individual from the main list 
   Move them onto a list for that team. 
    Apply to team information to that individual 
    
  Players can move from one team to another, but they should only appear on one list at a time. 
    If a play is moved from one team to another, the team information should be replaced with the team they moved to.
